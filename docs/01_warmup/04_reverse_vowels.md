# Reverse Vowels (easy)

## Problem Statement

---

Given a string `s`, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`, and they can appear in
both lower and upper cases, more than once.

```
Input: s= "hello"
Output: "holle"
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s= "AEIOU"
Output: "UOIEA"
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: s= "DesignGUrus"
Output: "DusUgnGires"
```
