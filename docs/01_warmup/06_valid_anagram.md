# Valid Anagram (easy)

## Problem Statement

---

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and
`false` otherwise.

An _Anagram_ is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "listen", t = "silent"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "hello", t = "world"
Output: false
```
