# Number of Good Pairs (easy)

## Problem Statement

---

Given an array of integers `nums`, return the number of good pairs.

A pair `(i, j)` is called good if `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `i < j`.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs, here are the indices: (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5).
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array is a 'good pair'.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: words = nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: No number is repeating.
```
